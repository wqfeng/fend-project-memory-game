# Welcome to Memory Game!


You just need to open the `index.html` to let the fun begin~

## Dependencies

I build this game with native dom methods to keep the code clean. It doesn't depend any 3rd party libraries. No more jQuery and Boostrap. Just HTML, CSS and JavaScript! I find the new Udacity courses on ES6 is awesome!
