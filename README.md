# Welcome to Memory Game!

The game is built with plain HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Click the card to open it. Cards will flip over if the next card doesn't match with the open one. Your score will depend on moves taken to open all the cards. The less moves, the better.

## How to Play

You just need to open the `index.html` to let the fun begin~

## Dependencies

I build this game with native dom methods to keep the code clean. It doesn't depend any 3rd party libraries. No more jQuery and Boostrap. Just HTML, CSS and JavaScript! I find the new Udacity courses on ES6 is awesome!
